        Front-end developer based in Portland, OR, with experience in
        HTML-CSS, JavaScript, C# and React. <br /><br />Skilled in
        communication and problem-solving, I'm excited to bring creative UI
        designs and tech ideas to life in a client-focused environment.<br />
        <br />
        I am currently completing a full-time internship at iVet360, a
        Portland-based company, where I spend all day developing a
        collection of reusable components that can be employed on different
        websites of veterinary hospitals.

        <br /><br />These components encompass carousels, sliders, contact
        pages, grids, and informational pages. Mainly utilized PHP for
        WordPress, along with WordPress CMS, jQuery, and SCSS.

        <br /><br />I also work with graphic and web design with the Adobe Creative Suite and enjoy drawing illustrations on my iPad in my free time.
